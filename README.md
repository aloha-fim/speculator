The parable on making full use of a team to make a great product:

We are avoiding the path to least resistance: 
![alt text][logo]
```
> ~~"You do your thing. I will do my own thing. Let's meet up later"~~
> ~~"Good idea."~~

Actually this method is acceptable if there is an initial investment made to integrate the implementation; create an API to interact various software
platforms.
```

We are going into the rock tumbler instead: 
![alt text][logo]
```
> "See my classification system to identify beds, kithen, etc?"
> "Okay. Wait. No. Let's not train the model. Vector image output only."   

We are creating the software together, building upon an individual's code set and optimally producing a more robust application.
