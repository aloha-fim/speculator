Teamwork

The parable on making full use of a team to make a great product:

![alt text][logo] We are avoiding the path to least resistance: 
```
The easy way - "You do your thing. I will do my own thing. Let's meet up later"

Actually this method is acceptable if there is an initial investment made to integrate the implementation; 
create an API to interact various software platforms.
```

![alt text][logo] We are going into the rock tumbler instead: 
```
"See my classification system to identify beds, kithen, etc?"
"Okay. Wait. No. Let's not train the model. Vector image output only."   

We are creating and building upon the code set together to produce a more robust application.
