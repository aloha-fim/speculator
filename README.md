Teamwork

A parable on making full use of a team to make a great product:

[![Teamwork](https://i.imgur.com/OORFH52.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-Yv-UdsmSo "Teamwork")

![alt text][logo] We are avoiding the path to least resistance: 
```
The easy way - "You do your thing. I will do my own thing. Let's meet up later"  "Okay"

We are not risking the project through undefined requirements and minimal
investment (i.e. having no API backend to interact and integrate the app).
```

![alt text][logo] We are going into the rock tumbler instead: 
```
Our way - "See my classification system to identify beds, kithen, etc?"
"Okay. Wait. No. Let's not train the model. Vector image output only."   

We are creating and building upon the code set together to produce a more robust application.
